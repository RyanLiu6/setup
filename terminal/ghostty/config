# Ghostty Configuration

# Color scheme - change to eva02 for orange/red theme
config-file = colours/eva01

# Font settings
font-family = "FiraCode Nerd Font Mono"
font-size = 12

# Window settings
window-padding-x = 4
window-padding-y = 4

# Terminal settings
scrollback-limit = 1000

# Cursor
cursor-style = block
cursor-style-blink = false

# Shell integration
shell-integration = zsh

# macOS specific
# Option key behaves as Alt (for word movement shortcuts)
macos-option-as-alt = true

# Keybindings (matching iTerm2 behavior)
# Tab cycling - standard macOS style (same as Chrome, Safari, etc.)
keybind = cmd+shift+left_bracket=previous_tab
keybind = cmd+shift+right_bracket=next_tab
# Disable arrow-based tab cycling completely
keybind = cmd+shift+left=ignore
keybind = cmd+shift+right=ignore

# Word movement: Option+Arrow (works with macos-option-as-alt=true)
# These send escape sequences that zsh/bash interpret as word movement
keybind = alt+left=esc:b
keybind = alt+right=esc:f

# Line start/end: Cmd+Arrow
keybind = cmd+left=esc:OH
keybind = cmd+right=esc:OF

# Delete word backward: Option+Backspace
keybind = alt+backspace=esc:0x7f

# Delete to line start: Cmd+Backspace
keybind = cmd+backspace=text:\x15

# Ctrl+Backspace: Delete word backward (alternative to Alt+Backspace)
keybind = ctrl+backspace=esc:0x7f

# Shift+Enter: Send ESC+CR (legacy sequence) for compatibility with Claude Code and similar apps.
# Ghostty's default "fixterms" protocol sends [27;2;13~ which most apps don't recognize.
# This override sends \x1b\r which is what iTerm2 sends and apps expect.
# See: https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/1850
keybind = shift+enter=text:\x1b\r
