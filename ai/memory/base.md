# Base Global Rules

## Git Workflow
- **CRITICAL: NEVER commit and push without explicit user confirmation.** Always stop and ask before running `git commit` or `git push`. This is non-negotiable - no exceptions, even if the task seems complete.
- Always commit and push to a branch (generate a sensible name based on changes, with the format `ryanliu6/<feature-name>`). Never push to main / master unless I ask you to.
- Branch names must use hyphens (`-`) as separators, never underscores (`_`) or other characters.

## Code Style
- When asked to remove comments, docstrings, or reduce LoC - actually remove them completely. Do not leave any behind.
