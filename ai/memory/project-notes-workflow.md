# Project Notes & Memory Workflow

## Project-Specific Notes (`~/dev/docs/`)

- Location: `~/dev/docs/<repo-name>/<descriptive-name>.md`
- `<repo-name>` is the name of the git repo's root directory (e.g., working in `~/dev/foo/bar/my-repo` → docs go to `~/dev/docs/my-repo/`)
- When to create: Answers to questions like "How does X work?", "Where is Y implemented?"
- Include: Question, answer, code references, file paths
- Use `/clean-docs` to review and clean up stale docs

## Shared Memory (`~/aicli/shared/memory`)

**Only promote when user explicitly asks** ("Add this as a memory", "Save to core memory")

Candidates: Cross-project patterns, reusable workflows, general development practices
