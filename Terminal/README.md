# Terminal
To note, `Custom.terminal` is a custom terminal profile for the included `Terminal.app` application, while `purple.itermcolors` is a custom color scheme for iTerm2, my preferred terminal application. Feel free to use whichever!

After setup is ran, you'll have to do the following if you wish to install Python using pyenv:

```bash
xcode-select --install

brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib tcl-tk
```
