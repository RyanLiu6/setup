# setup

This is is a repo for personal dev setup.

## Editor
Currently, my editor of choice is Visual Studio Code with the Monokai Pro (Filtered Octagon) theme. Previously, it was Atom but performance was lacking compared to Code.

## Terminal
Due to the recent Mac OS Catalina Update, I've made the switch from bash to zsh. I've built my terminal to take full advantange of [spaceship-prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) and several personal customizations.

## Updates
As I am relatively new to Mac OS, I decided to create auto-updates using launchctl instead of a cron job. I would like to explore other options but launchctl does the job well enough.
